This is a simple and responsive Weather web app built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It uses [`OpenWeatherMap API`](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch Temperature, Weather, Humidity & Wind Speed details. It uses `OpenCageData Geocoder API` to fetch exact location coordinates of the user. Background images are fetched from `Unsplash` and is changed according to name of the city
